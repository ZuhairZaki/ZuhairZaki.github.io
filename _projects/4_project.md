title: Implementation of RTT Estimatior using Adaptive Kalman Filtering in ns3
description: |
    *CSE 322: Computer Networks Sessional*
    - In ns3 a first-order low-pass filter rtt estimator is implemented. 
    - For better RTT estimation, implemented an adaptive filter based on kalman filtering with change detection proposed in this [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Round-trip-time-estimation-in-communication-using-Jacobsson-Hjalmarsson/b73f2bd3064a4fa73282b0c6316ac90daa963a12)
