Hi, I am S. M. Zuhair Zaki. I graduated from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) with a B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in 2023. I am currently working as Software Security Engineer at [OpenRefactory, Inc.](https://www.openrefactory.com/) As part of my duties, I also find and report vulnerabilities in open source projects supported by [Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)](https://openssf.org/):[Project Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/).

I used to participate in CTF competitions during my undergraduate. Me and my team **fSociety** achieved 3rd place in [National CyberDrill 2022](https://www.cirt.gov.bd/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Press-Release-NCD-2022.pdf). I also co-founded the [BUET Cyber Security Club](https://buetsec.github.io/about/).

### Research Interests

My research interests lie in the broader field of **Security and Privacy**. Particularly, I am interested in researching and developing secure software, frameworks, protocols and cryptographic schemes to safeguard modern software systems, networks and emerging technologies.
